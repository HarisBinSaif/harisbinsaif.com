# Data Quality Best Practices: Prevention Over Detection

A deep dive into how data quality issues can cascade through your entire system. Prevention strategies that actually work.

## The Cost of Poor Data Quality

Poor data quality costs organizations billions annually. But more importantly, it erodes trust in your data systems and leads to poor business decisions.

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Schema Validation at Ingestion

Validate data structure before it enters your system:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class CustomerData(BaseModel):
    customer_id: str
    email: str
    age: int
    
    @validator('email')
    def validate_email(cls, v):
        if '@' not in v:
            raise ValueError('Invalid email')
        return v
    
    @validator('age')
    def validate_age(cls, v):
        if v < 0 or v > 150:
            raise ValueError('Invalid age')
        return v
```

### 2. Data Contracts

Define clear contracts between systems:

- Expected schema
- Data freshness requirements
- Quality SLAs

### 3. Automated Testing

Treat data pipelines like code—write tests:

```python
def test_data_quality():
    data = load_test_data()
    assert data.is_complete()
    assert data.has_no_duplicates()
    assert data.matches_schema()
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Completeness**: Are all expected records present?
2. **Accuracy**: Does data match expected values?
3. **Consistency**: Is data consistent across systems?
4. **Timeliness**: Is data arriving on schedule?

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure alerts for:

- Schema violations
- Unusual data volumes
- Missing data
- Quality score drops

## Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Validate data at the source
- [ ] Implement data contracts
- [ ] Write automated tests
- [ ] Monitor quality metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting
- [ ] Document quality requirements
- [ ] Review and improve regularly

## Real-World Example

In one project, implementing schema validation at ingestion reduced data quality issues by 80% and saved the team 10+ hours per week in manual data cleaning.

## Conclusion

Preventing data quality issues is always cheaper than fixing them downstream. Invest in validation, testing, and monitoring from day one.
